# T1A2 Portfolio Website

Deployed page: https://main--sophiewoolford.netlify.app/
Github repository: https://github.com/woolfie59/portfolioWebsite

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to deploy a website which works as a portfolio. This is to showcase my skills, my experience and pas and current projects, which might all be relevant to a potential employer within the IT industry. As well as technical aspects, I am also showcasing other more personal information which is intended to give the user a better idea of me as a person, including personal interests and other personal projects and experiences which might make me a good fit in the company.

## Functionality / features
When first accessing the page, the user reaches the home page. This whole site has been built with flexbox to allow any user, regardless if using desktop, mobile or another view, a similar experience when using the site. The navigation bar can be seen and accessed throught the whole site.
This first page works as an intro to the theme which is ongoing throughout the site. The blue colour which displays my name as well as the navigation bar, is actually my favourite colour. It therefore made sence for me to use this colour as the main and ongoing colour at the top of the page, including displaying my name. When the user hovers over each component on the navbar, the text becomes bold and underlined to emphasise which part of the navbar is selected. The background colour of each component also highlights in yellow at the same time for an even more accessible design. The yellow accent colour throughout the website is a nod to my Swedish heritage, as the colours blue and yellow make up the Swedish flag. This is also great for accessibility as blue and yellow are oposite on the colourwheel and therefore displays a bigger contrast between highlighted and dormant elements. The other accent colour - emerald green - is a shoutout to my partner whose favourite colour is green, and a little way for me to include him in this project after all his support and hype for my coding experience.

The project page displays three cards, each representing a hypothetical project of mine. These can be seen with some placeholder pictures featuring some code. The cards themselves are yellow with a small box-shadow off dark  blue which is another of the site's accent colours. This is just a continuation of the blue theme, but made darker for use as a contrast colour. When the user hovers over each card, the card turns green to highlight with card is selected and the box-shadow is removed for further emphesis and some engagement for the user. In the future, with real projects displayed, each card can be used to redirect the user to an individual page showcasing the project in detail.

The contact page displays another picture of myself. This is to engage the user and almost "remind them" who they would be reaching out to on the links. I have providied placeholder email, phone number and github link, as well as a button with a link to an external document for a resume. In its current state, the file is empty a part from displaying "mock up resume."

The about me page displays a section each foor my backgroud and skills. The listed skills are of course only placeholder for now, and the background section with lorem ipsum would be displaying professional background, work experience, project work, as well as some personal information such as hobbies and other interest which may or may not be relevant to the IT field.

The final page on the site is a blog summary page. Here the user can find a summary of recent blog posts. Keeping with the theme of the website, when the user hovers over each card displaying a blog post, the yellow colour changes to green and the small box-shadow is removed to highlight with post is selected. Each blog post has a relevant picture as well as a publication date for that post. These cards can redirect the user to each blog posts page with the full article. The current page does not have this feature however, as these are placeholder posts to display the view only. This page as also  been made with flaxbox and depending on the users screen size, the cards may show all in a row or be in a colomn view if the user's screen is small enough.

## Sitemap
The sitemap displys the overview of the website, starting with the home page. As mentioned previously, the navigation bar is accessible from all pages on the site. This is why the sitemap shows the home page as part of the first row of pages as well as at the top of the map. The red colour of the navbar button is to draw the user to view the bubble at the top of the map which explains the navbar's accessibility.

From the projects box is a branch to each of the three project pages. But as a reminder these are not currently active due to the cards being place holders. This is the same for the blog posts boxes. Each card on the blog page represents one of the boxes on the site map as these would have individual pages is something was actually published.

## Target audience
The target audience for this website portfolio is a potential employer and to use as a tool in networking. I imagine a start up or a younger company with more free views rather than a tech giant. Hopefully with a recruited who has a bit of a sence of humour or does not have a completely strict view on things.

## Tech stack
  - html (html5)
  - css for styling
  - netlify for site deployment
  - github for repository
