## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to deploy a website which works as a portfolio. This is to showcase my skills, my experience and past and current projects, which might all be relevant to a potential employer within the IT industry. As well as technical aspects, I am also showcasing other more personal information which is intended to give the user a better idea of me as a person, including personal interests and other personal projects and experiences which might make me a good fit in the company.

## Functionality / features
When first accessing the page, the user reaches the home page. This whole site has been built with flexbox to allow any user, regardless if using desktop, mobile or another view, a similar experience when using the site. The navigation bar can be seen and accessed through the whole site.
This first page works as an intro to the theme which is ongoing throughout the site. The blue colour which displays my name as well as the navigation bar, is actually my favourite colour. It therefore made sense for me to use this colour as the main and ongoing colour at the top of the page, including displaying my name. When the user hovers over each component on the navbar, the text becomes bold and underlined to emphasise which part of the navbar is selected. The background colour of each component also highlights in yellow at the same time for an even more accessible design. The yellow accent colour throughout the website is a nod to my Swedish heritage, as the colours blue and yellow make up the Swedish flag. This is also great for accessibility as blue and yellow are opposite on the colourwheel and therefore displays a bigger contrast between highlighted and dormant elements. The other accent colour - emerald green - is a shoutout to my partner whose favourite colour is green, and a little way for me to include him in this project after all his support and hype for my coding experience.

The project page displays three cards, each representing a hypothetical project of mine. These can be seen with some placeholder pictures featuring some code. The cards themselves are yellow with a small box-shadow off dark  blue which is another of the site's accent colours. This is just a continuation of the blue theme, but made darker for use as a contrast colour. When the user hovers over each card, the card turns green to highlight which card is selected and the box-shadow is removed for further emphasis and some engagement for the user. In the future, with real projects displayed, each card can be used to redirect the user to an individual page showcasing the project in detail.

The contact page displays another picture of myself. This is to engage the user and almost "remind them" who they would be reaching out to on the links. I have provided a placeholder email, phone number and github link, as well as a button with a link to an external document for a resume. In its current state, the file is empty apart from displaying "mock up resume."

The about me page displays a section each for my background and skills. The listed skills are of course only placeholder for now, and the background section with lorem ipsum would be displaying professional background, work experience, project work, as well as some personal information such as hobbies and other interests which may or may not be relevant to the IT field.

The final page on the site is a blog summary page. Here the user can find a summary of recent blog posts. Keeping with the theme of the website, when the user hovers over each card displaying a blog post, the yellow colour changes to green and the small box-shadow is removed to highlight which post is selected. Each blog post has a relevant picture as well as a publication date for that post. These cards can redirect the user to each blog posts page with the full article. The current page does not have this feature however, as these are placeholder posts to display the view only. This page has also been made with flexbox and depending on the user's screen size, the cards may show all in a row or be in a column view if the user's screen is small enough.

The color scheme I chose includes a total of six colours. Simple black (#000000) and white (#ffffff), as well as vista blue (#80a4edff), sunglow yellow (#ffcb47ff), emerald green (#16c172ff), and indigo-dye blue (#344966ff). I wanted to make the site colourful in a fun way to engage the user. Happy colours which unbeknownst to the user also represented me. But I wanted to make sure that the user does not feel overwhelmed with too many or too bright colours covering large areas at once. With the base of black and white, the colourful components of each page, generally, are interactable or highlights elements.

## Wireframes
I created the wireframes before starting to build my website and they were very helpful along the process. They were great to refer back to while I was building to remind me of my design ideas, but also, while I was creating the wireframes, it helped me visualise each page with the lay out I wanted. Some elements changed while I was creating the wireframes; for example, I wanted to include a custom logo in the top right corner of the header to balance out the visual with my full name on the left. However, I was quite happy with keeping just my name in the header, which in itself became a logo of sorts as the portfolio is to showcase me. In the future I might add a logo to the right however, to bulk up the page a bit content wise. I wanted to keep everything simple for my very first website build and therefore I removed the logo before finalising the wireframes. 

Something which was different between the completed website and the wireframes was the coverage area of the main page picture. On the mobile view, the picture covers the whole width of the screen and on desktop view it covers a very large part of it with a bit of margin on each side. However, once I was building the page I found that the extremely large picture felt aggressive and intrusive visually. I therefore decided to set a max-width for the picture and later added the rounded green frame to further soften its appearance.

On each wireframe, each gray box with a black cross over it represents a picture, and the heading with 'Sophie Woolford' and the navbar is visible. 

Index page: the user is greeted by the 'welcome' heading, an initial picture of me and a paragraph with an introductory message.

Projects page: displays a heading and a card for each project. These cards redirect the user to the individual pages of each project. In the desktop view these cards are displayed horizontally and on the mobile view the cards are displayed vertically.

Contact page: has a picture of me on the left and a paragraph listing contact details. Below the contact details is a button which redirects the user to a PDF of my resume. The button is displayed in a different colour to highlight that it is interactable. In the mobile view, these elements are displayed vertically.

About page:  the about me page has a central picture of me with a paragraph to the left and right. The paragraph on the left displays background information about me and the paragraph on the right lists skills of mine. In the mobile view these elements are displayed vertically. This page has a simple layout and design as the elements are not interactable.

Blog page: the blog page looks similar to the projects page. It displays cards for each blog post, which are central to the page. On the mobile view these are listed vertically and the wider the user's screen is, the more cards are displayed side by side horizontally.

## Sitemap
The sitemap displays the overview of the website, starting with the home page. As mentioned previously, the navigation bar is accessible from all pages on the site. This is why the sitemap shows the home page as part of the first row of pages as well as at the top of the map. The red colour of the navbar button is to draw the user to view the bubble at the top of the map which explains the navbar's accessibility.

From the projects box is a branch to each of the three project pages. But as a reminder these are not currently active due to the cards being placeholders. This is the same for the blog posts boxes. Each card on the blog page represents one of the boxes on the site map as these would have individual pages if something was actually published.

## Target audience
The target audience for this website portfolio is a potential employer and to use as a networking tool. I imagine a startup or a younger company with more free views rather than a tech giant. Hopefully with a recruiter who has a bit of a sense of humour or does not have a completely strict view on things.
